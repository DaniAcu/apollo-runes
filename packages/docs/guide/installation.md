# Installation

## Installation

Install `apollo-runes` and peer dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add apollo-runes @apollo/client graphql rxjs
# or
npm i apollo-runes @apollo/client graphql rxjs
# or
yarn add apollo-runes @apollo/client graphql rxjs
```

> Same as [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started#step-2-install-dependencies) for React

## Requirements

- Svelte 5
- Apollo Client v4
- GraphQL JS runtime
- RxJS

## Why Apollo Client?

`apollo-runes` is a thin, Svelte-5-runes-native layer over Apollo Client primitives. You get Apollo's normalized caching, pagination helpers, error policies, and ecosystem while writing idiomatic Svelte.

Learn more in Apollo's docs: [Apollo Client (Web) - v4](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react).
