# Installation

## Installation

Install `apollo-runes` and peer dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add apollo-runes @apollo/client graphql
# or
npm i apollo-runes @apollo/client graphql
# or
yarn add apollo-runes @apollo/client graphql
```

## Requirements

- Svelte 5
- Apollo Client v3 or v4 (recommended v4)
- GraphQL JS runtime

## Why Apollo Client?

`apollo-runes` is a thin, Svelte-5-runes-native layer over Apollo Client primitives. You get Apollo's normalized caching, pagination helpers, error policies, and ecosystem while writing idiomatic Svelte.

Learn more in Apollo's docs: [Apollo Client (Web) - v4](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react).
